# React Application with GitHub Pages and GitHub Actions Workflows

The purpose of this app is to publish a React application to GitHub Pages and taking advantage of the free GitHub Actions Workflows.

For this workflow, A container with Linux Ubuntu and Node.JS was generated with the workflow.yml file

### Dependencies
GitHub pages Package: gh-pages

### GitHub Pages Deploy Action 🚀
This GitHub Action will automatically deploy your project to GitHub Pages. It can be configured to push your production-ready code into any branch you'd like, including gh-pages and docs. It can also handle cross repository deployments and works with GitHub Enterprise too.

### Tutorial
I have created a step by step tutorial to document the process how to publish a React Application to Github Pages with GitHub Action workflows:

# About React

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
